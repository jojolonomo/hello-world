# hello-world
My first project in GitHub
I'm teaching myself HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL.  I've started duplicating a website in Webflow by writing this from scratch.
So far I've restarted about ten times with ideas and had to modify all my modules as I switch more from HTML to PHP.
I am now at a point where I need to control the source used in my project so I've decided to use github.
I use VS Code as my editor and I've managed to set up IIS, PHP and MySQL on my PC.  Wish me luck!

P.S. I started life as a programmer back in the late 1960s with various assembler languages but moved into management.
Now I'm retired I'm quite enjoying learning some new languages.
